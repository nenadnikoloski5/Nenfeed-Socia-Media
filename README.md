# How to get started
 - Import the SQL file inside of the "IMPORT THIS" folder. If you are a bit iffy about importing some file, you can open it inside of a text editor and see the content of it.
 
 I use MySQL Workbench, but there is a import option in phpmyadmin too.
 It will create a database called "social_media" and 6 tables, users, posts, comments, likes, friend_requests and messages.
